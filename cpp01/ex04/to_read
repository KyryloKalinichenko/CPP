What is love?
Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Baby, don't hurt me, don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
Yeah
No, I don't know why you're not fair
I give you my love, but you don't care
So what is right and what is wrong?
Gimme a sign
What is love? It is code!
Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh
